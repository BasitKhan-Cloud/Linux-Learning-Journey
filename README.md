Tracking my progress as I learn Linux basics with scripts and notes

Welcome to my repo! I'm documenting my progress as I learn Linux fundamentals, starting with basic commands and scripts. This is part of my journey to become a cloud computing engineer. Expect bash scripts, notes, and small projects as I go!

## Current Focus
- Basic commands (ls, cd, mkdir)
- Writing simple bash scripts

## Latest Commit
- `list_files.sh`: A script to list files in a directory.
